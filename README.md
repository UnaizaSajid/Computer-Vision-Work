**CBIS-DDSM Dataset of Mammograms**

The Digital Database for Screening Mammography has been upgraded and standardized as the CBIS-DDSM (Curated Breast Imaging Subset of DDSM). There are 2,620 digitized film mammography studies in the DDSM database. It includes instances with certified pathology data for normal, benign, and cancerous samples. The official website of the dataset is: https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/Public/CBIS-DDSM

The above dataset is used for research purposes with the intent to detect cancerous mass with the help of Convolution Neural Nets Architectures. Before applying the transfer learning technique, the image is been converted into .png format and resized. Moreover, techniques like LBP and HOG are also applied to extract the hand-crafted features of an image.
